## Background

Many Korean international students receive their allowance in Korean Won (KRW) while spending primarily in U.S. Dollars (USD). This makes it difficult to accurately understand real spending value due to exchange rate fluctuations.  
Spend Abroad addresses this problem by providing automatic dual-currency tracking and intuitive spending visualization.
